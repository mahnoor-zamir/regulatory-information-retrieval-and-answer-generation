            "disclosures to be prepared in accordance with the mining reporting standards . the fsra considers that rules 11.2.1 and 11.2.2 are the most important rules in relation to the requirement for minerals activity disclosures within adgm . rule 11.2.1 requires that any disclosure by a mining reporting entity that includes a statement about exploration targets , exploration results , mineral resources , ore reserves or production targets , must be prepared in accordance with a mining reporting standard and in accordance with the requirements of mkt chapter 11 .",
            "production targets what can they be disclosed in relation to ? rule 11.8.34 provides that , among other things , the inferred mineral resources and exploration target as applicable do not feature as a significant proportion in the early mine plan . the proportion of inferred mineral resources and an exploration target that may be added to the end of the mine plan depends on the maturity of a mining project . for example , a greater proportion may be justified by a producing mine or a mining production reporting entity with a history of converting exploration targets and mineral resources into ore reserves , than a mining exploration reporting entity that has indicated mineral resources as the highest confidence mineral resource . for the purpose of this rule , therefore , the fsra interprets the phrase significant proportion to mean 25 or less of the mineralisation used to determine the production target is attributed to inferred mineral resources andor an exploration target .",
            "non-equivalent estimates when can non-equivalent estimates be disclosed ? rule 11.2.1 operates such that any disclosure relating to exploration targets , exploration results , mineral resources or ore reserves is to be prepared in accordance with a mining reporting standard . rule 11.7.2 provides an exception to rule 11.2.1 for a mining reporting entity where that mining reporting entity discloses material non-equivalent estimates of mineralisation . non-equivalent estimates are estimates classified under a reporting standard which is not deemed by the fsra as a mining reporting standard .",
            "concepts relating to the disclosure of mining activities what is a mining reporting entity ? there are two types of mining reporting entities under the rules , being either a a mining exploration reporting entity or b a mining production reporting entity .",
            "concepts relating to the disclosure of mining activities what is a mining reporting entity ? the fsra may exercise its power to advise a reporting entity that it is a mining exploration reporting entity or a mining production reporting entity for the purposes of the rules if , in the fsras opinion , the reporting entity undertakes mining activity that comprises , or is over time likely to comprise , such a material part of the overall activity of the reporting entity that it is appropriate for the reporting entity to be subject to the quarterly activity , and other periodic , disclosure obligations set out in chapter 11 of the rules ."

        "Answer": "To prove adherence to the appropriate mining reporting standard when disclosing exploration targets and production targets, the financial services regulatory authority (fsra) requires a mining reporting entity to provide specific documentation and verification. This is outlined in the regulatory documents, particularly in rules 11.2.1, 11.2.2, 11.7.2, and 11.8.34 of the mkt chapter 11. **required documentation:** 1. **disclosure statement:** a mining reporting entity must prepare a disclosure statement that includes statements about exploration targets, exploration results, mineral resources, ore reserves, or production targets. This statement must be prepared in accordance with a mining reporting standard and the requirements of mkt chapter 11. 2. **mining reporting standard:** the disclosure statement must comply with a recognized mining reporting standard, such as the australasian code for reporting of exploration results, mineral resources and ore reserves (jorc code) or the canadian institute of mining, metallurgy and petroleum (cim) definition standards. 3. **inferred mineral resources and exploration targets:** when disclosing production targets, the mining reporting entity must ensure that inferred mineral resources and exploration targets do not feature as a significant proportion (not more than 25%) in the early mine plan. **verification requirements:** 1. **compliance with mining reporting standard:** the fsra will verify that the disclosure statement complies with the requirements of the applicable mining reporting standard. 2. **material non-equivalent estimates:** if the mining reporting entity discloses material non-equivalent estimates of mineralization, the fsra will verify that these estimates are classified under a reporting standard that is not deemed a mining reporting standard. 3. **mining reporting entity classification:** the fsra may exercise its power to advise a reporting entity that it is a mining exploration reporting entity or a mining production reporting entity, if the entity undertakes mining activity that comprises a material part of its overall activity. **procedures for verification:** 1. **review of disclosure statement:** the fsra will review the disclosure statement to ensure that it complies with the requirements of the applicable mining reporting standard and mkt chapter 11. 2. **verification of data:** the fsra may request additional data or information to verify the accuracy of the disclosure statement, including data related to inferred mineral resources and exploration targets. 3. **audit and inspection:** the fsra may conduct audits and inspections to verify the compliance of the mining reporting entity with the requirements of mkt chapter 11 and the applicable mining reporting standard. In summary, to prove adherence to the appropriate mining reporting standard when disclosing exploration targets and production targets, a mining reporting entity must provide a comprehensive disclosure statement that complies with the requirements of the applicable mining reporting standard and mkt chapter 11. The fsra will verify the accuracy and compliance of the disclosure statement through a review of the statement, verification of data, and, if necessary, audits and inspections."
